### EduStreamPro Advanced Implementation Prompt  
Extend the enterprise e-learning platform with cutting-edge features while maintaining production-grade architecture. Add these advanced capabilities to the existing structure without creating new files or modifying specifications. Only write code - strictly follow all prohibitions.

### Advanced Features to Implement  
1. **Neural Learning Paths**  
   - AI-driven content recommendations based on engagement patterns  
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment for quizzes using performance analytics  
   - Predictive progress modeling with regression algorithms  

2. **Immersive Learning**  
   - WebGL-powered 3D lab environments (chemistry/physics)  
   - Interactive VR scene integration via WebXR API  
   - Holographic instructor projections using TensorFlow.js  

3. **Blockchain Verification**  
   - NFT credential minting for course completion  
   - Decentralized transcript storage on IPFS  
   - Smart contract-based certification validation  

4. **Biometric Authentication**  
   - WebAuthn integration for passwordless login  
   - Behavioral analysis (keystroke dynamics/mouse patterns)  
   - Multi-factor authentication via Web Bluetooth  

5. **Quantum-Resistant Security**  
   - Post-quantum cryptography (Kyber/Dilithium)  
   - Homomorphic video encryption  
   - Zero-knowledge proof verification  

### Technical Implementation Rules  
1. Integrate features within EXISTING files only  
2. Maintain original file structure precisely  
3. All code must be comment-free  
4. Enterprise architecture cannot be simplified  
5. Prohibitions remain fully enforced:  
   - NO command execution  
   - NO code explanations  
   - NO additional files  
   - NO terminal commands  
   - NO database implementations  
   - NO application execution  
   - NO architecture simplifications  

### Critical Technical Enhancements  
**Backend (NestJS)**  
- `video-processing.service.ts`: Implement homomorphic encryption for video segments  
- `quiz.gateway.ts`: Add quantum-resistant handshake protocol  
- `course-management.service.ts`: Integrate neural recommendation engine  

**Frontend (Vue 3)**  
- `VideoPlayer.vue`: Add WebXR integration for VR classrooms  
- `CodeEvaluator.vue`: Implement quantum-safe code verification  
- `AnalyticsDashboard.vue`: Add neural prediction visualizations  

**Shared Systems**  
- `s3-adapter.ts`: Implement IPFS decentralized storage layer  
- `websocket-service.ts`: Add post-quantum encryption layer  
- `course-types.ts`: Define NFT credential data structures  

**Generate updated files with advanced features integrated into the original structure. Maintain strict production readiness and enterprise standards.**
